# Zip codes

Unable to find a suitable data source for zip codes and their boundaries, I wrote/hacked up this node script to go out and do it for me. It uses the Census data from 2000, the latest that is publicly available. After it's done you should have a ~103mb JSON file ready to be used by [d3.js](http://d3js.org). If you want the output in a different format feel free to fork your own version and have at it.
